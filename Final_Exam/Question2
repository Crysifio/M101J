Please use the Enron dataset you imported for the previous problem.
For this question you will use the aggregation framework to figure
out pairs of people that tend to communicate a lot. To do this, you
will need to unwind the To list for each message.

This problem is a little tricky because a recipient may appear more
than once in the To list for a message. You will need to fix that in
a stage of the aggregation before doing your grouping and counting of
(sender, recipient) pairs.

Query:
db.messages.aggregate([
    { $unwind: "$headers.To" },
    { $project: { _id: 0, to: "$headers.To", from: "$headers.From"} },
    { $group: { _id: {"from": "$from", "to": "$to"}, count: { $sum: 1 } } },
    { $sort: { count: -1 } },
    { $limit: 5 }
])
